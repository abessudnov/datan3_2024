### Data report

Your data report is due on Thursday 28 March (2pm) and it is worth 50% of your final mark. The length of your report should be approximately 1,500 words (tables, figures and the code excluded).

For your report you need to conduct an independent analysis of the Understanding Society data (or another data set as confirmed by the module convenor) to answer one of the questions below. I intentionally do not suggest a plan for your analysis. You will need to make decisions about the features of the data you want to present in your reports and the best way of doing this.

Please choose one of the following questions.

1. Do people become happier or unhappier after getting divorced? Explore how life satisfaction changes after divorce, for men and women.

2. Are immigrants more likely to receive benefits?

If you want to explore a different question please feel free to speak to me about this. One of the options is to collect your own data online and then analyse it.

Below are some recommendations for completing the reports.

Question 1 involves an analysis of longitudinal data. This assignment tests your ability to work with multiple data sets (join them, reshape, organise as tidy data, etc.).

Your reports should have the maximum of four tables or graphs (you can decide yourself how many tables and graphs you want as long as the total number is no more than four). I will mark you down if you have more than four graphs and tables.

This assignment is not about complex statistical modelling. It tests your ability to work with data and present descriptive statistics in a comprehensive way, both as tables and graphs.

Your reports should have a clear main message. Narrowing the topic down to one or two smaller questions and explore them carefully and in detail is better than presenting a lot of poorly interpreted numbers on different aspects of your main question.

I do not expect you to present a detailed literature review. That said, you may want to read two or three papers (possibly reviews) published in reputable journals in the last 10 years, and summarise the state of art in about two paragraphs of your report.

Your reports must be written in R Markdown and show all the code for the analysis (not included in word count). The code must start with reading the Understanding Society data and show all steps of the analysis and the output. Please knit your report as a pdf or Word file (to be submitted on Bart). Please do not submit an .Rmd file.
